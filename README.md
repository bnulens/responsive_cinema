## Exercise

In this exercise, you'll be required to make a responsive website for a movie theater, so let your creativity and imagination run wild.

The website has to be responsive for the following screen sizes:
* extra small (< 576px)
* small (< 768px)
* medium (< 992px)
* large (< 1200px)
* extra large (> 1200px)

The exercise keeps going until the deadline is reached. There's always new things you can add to your website. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself!

**Some tips to get started**

- Design for mobile first, and build on that.
- Make a checklist of all the features you feel a cinema page should have.
- Make a sketch/mockup of the webpage first. It helps to write CSS if you have a visual example!
